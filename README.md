The core function of this GPT involves the provision of your personal data (email address) to a third party.

Period of Retention: The email address will be retained in the Google Sheet database until deletion request.
Data Flow: The email address is provided by the user within the GPT, and this information is securely transmitted via an HTTPS API call (Action) from the Custom GPT environment directly to our designated Google Sheet.
# Data Processing Principles and Compliance
Alignment with Korean PIPA Principles:
Lawfulness and Purpose Specification (PIPA Art. 3(1)): We specify the exact purpose (Custom ID, participant tracking) and rely on the user's explicit consent for collection and third-party provision.
Minimum Necessary Collection (PIPA Art. 3(1)): Only the email address is requested for the Custom ID function.
Safety Management (PIPA Art. 29): Data transmission is secured using industry-standard HTTPS/SSL encryption to protect against unauthorized access or improper use during transit to the Google Sheet.
Alignment with Finnish TENK Principles:
Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) / Accountability: We are accountable for the ethical and legal handling of the data. This policy ensures full transparency regarding the purpose and flow of the data.
Data Protection and Confidentiality: Although this is a functional GPT and not formal research, we adhere to the principles of data protection by minimizing collection and securing the external data storage location.
# User Rights (Data Subject Rights)
In accordance with PIPA and general data protection standards, you have the following rights:
Right to Access: You may request confirmation of whether your personal information is being processed and request access to it.
Right to Correction/Deletion: You may request that we correct any inaccurate information or request the deletion of your email address from our Google Sheet/database.
Right to Refuse Consent: You have the right to refuse consent to the collection and use of your email address. However, refusing consent will mean you cannot use the GPT's Action feature, as the email is required for the Custom ID function.
To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information in Section 7.
# Third-Party Service Provider (OpenAI)
Your interactions with the GPT are subject to the OpenAI Privacy Policy (available on the OpenAI website). OpenAI processes the conversational data (Prompts and Responses) but we do not share the collected email address directly with OpenAI for their model training.

We may update this policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or relevant laws. We encourage you to review this page occasionally.
